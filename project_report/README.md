## **Problem and Design Overview**
For this project, we focused on streamlining task management and simplifying the map import process. Many users reported feeling overwhelmed by the volume of tasks displayed and noted redundancy across several of them. Additionally, importing maps was a tedious process. Users had to locate a map using a third-party service like Google Maps, take a screenshot, and manually upload it into Synchro Studios. They then had to draw lanes over the imported image to begin adjusting parameters. To address these challenges, we implemented a minimalistic design aimed at reducing cognitive load and enhancing the learning experience for our target audience.


## **Design Walkthrough**
For our design we chose two main tasks to focus on and work to improve. We wanted to make the lane settings more new uesr friendly, and provide a better way to import a road map. 
#### Importing Maps
The goal was that a user should be able to import a map directly from 3rd party services like google or apple maps or upload an image. If the image isn't clear, the user should be able to be redirected to a help page and find a way to fix the issue. 


#### Lane Settings
After they have imported the map, the lane settings were the next task we chose to work on. We wanted to simplifiy the settings and add a search bar to immediatly find parameters of a lane. Not only that but we wanted to clearly show which lane you have selected by highlighting it on the map as well as the header bar of the lane settings. 


## Design Research 
#### Research Process
The goal from our user research was to focus on new users and the struggles they faced when learning the software, as well as a larger
scale perspective of all types or users both novice and experienced to see what common issues they all faced. With that in mind we 
chose two methods of user research: participation observations and surveys. We observed new users in a Civil Engineering classroom 
where the class had never used the software before, and then sent out a survay to not only those students but other instructors and 
people who possibly had experience.
#### Key Insights
- *New users struggle with importing a map*: While obeserving the engineering class we noticed multiple students struggling to work with importing a google image and using it
  to create an intersection. We decided to then make this one of our main tasks since it seemed impractical for users to be tabbing 
  between Synchro and google maps constantly.
- *The lane Settings are overwhelming to new users*: From both the survay and observations we noticed that the lane settings in general were very hard to grasp. There was too much information displayed at once, and it was difficult to find individual parameters as needed.
- *Adding a new lane is not intuitive*: From the observation study, it appeared that many new users didn't find the way to add lanes easy or sefl explanitory. Our goal was to make it clear when you add a lane and to make it visually obvious what lane you are currently using.
