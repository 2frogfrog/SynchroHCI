### **Problem and Design Overview**

### Design Research 
#### Research Process
The goal from our user research was to focus on new users and the struggles they faced when learning the software, as well as a larger
scale perspective of all types or users both novice and experienced to see what common issues they all faced. With that in mind we 
chose two methods of user research: participation observations and surveys. We observed new users in a Civil Engineering classroom 
where the class had never used the software before, and then sent out a survay to not only those students but other instructors and 
people who possibly had experience.
#### Key Insights
- *New users struggle with importing a map*: While obeserving the engineering class we noticed multiple students struggling to work with importing a google image and using it
  to create an intersection. We decided to then make this one of our main tasks since it seemed impractical for users to be tabbing 
  between Synchro and google maps constantly.
- *The lane Settings are overwhelming to new users*: From both the survay and observations we noticed that the lane settings in general were very hard to grasp. There was too much information displayed at once, and it was difficult to find individual parameters as needed.
  Not only that but it did not seem intuitive add a lane, or even know what lane you were currently working with.
